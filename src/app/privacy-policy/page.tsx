          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            Your right to manage your data (listed above) is separate from your right to cancel your financial subscription. To cancel your recurring fitness subscription, you must follow the procedures outlined in our Terms and Conditions of Service (T&C), particularly regarding the non-refundable nature of fees (T&C Section 3.2). Canceling your subscription does not automatically delete all retained legal and financial data.
